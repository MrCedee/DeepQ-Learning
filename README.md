# Reinforcement Learning Project: Deep Q-Learning and Continuous Action Spaces

This project explores the application of Deep Q-Learning and reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. Although the primary goal of successfully training the BipedalWalker environment was not achieved, the work done here lays a solid foundation for future research and experimentation.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Train the BipedalWalker-v3 environment using Deep Q-Learning.
- **Challenges**: Adapting Actor-Critic methods to continuous action spaces.
- **Outcome**: While training BipedalWalker was not successful, this project provided valuable insights and a strong starting point for further exploration.

## Key Concepts

- **Deep Q-Learning**: A reinforcement learning technique that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function.
- **Continuous Action Spaces**: Unlike discrete action spaces, continuous spaces require sampling actions from a distribution, which introduces additional complexity.
- **Actor-Critic Method**: A reinforcement learning algorithm where the "actor" decides actions, and the "critic" evaluates them.

## Future Work

- Experiment with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and hybrid methods.
- Continue refining approaches for complex environments like BipedalWalker.

## Code Structure

The code is based on the Keras implementation of DDPG for the Pendulum environment, with adaptations for continuous action spaces. The focus is on the key modifications made to handle these continuous spaces.
